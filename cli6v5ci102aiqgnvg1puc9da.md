> Understanding the behaviour of Software Products

In today's complex and ever-changing world, it is more important than ever to be able to understand the behaviour of your systems. Observability engineering is a discipline that helps you do just that.

**Observability is the degree to which the internal state and behaviour of a system can be inferred from its external outputs.** 

In other words, it's about gaining insights into what's happening within a system based on its observable external behaviours. Unlike monitoring, which focuses on collecting predefined metrics, observability is about uncovering the unknown unknowns and understanding the system's holistic behaviour. It goes beyond simple metrics to encompass logs, traces, events, and other contextual data.

Observability engineering is the practice of collecting and analyzing telemetry data from your systems in order to gain insights into their behaviour. This data can be used to identify problems before they cause outages, to understand the impact of changes to your systems, and to make better decisions about how to improve them.

## Pillars of Observability

Observability engineering is built upon three core pillars: logs, metrics, and traces.

- **Logs:** Logs capture valuable information about the activities and events happening within a system. They provide a chronological record of events, errors, warnings, and other relevant data points. Analyzing logs can help identify patterns, anomalies, and potential issues, leading to better understanding and troubleshooting.

- **Metrics:** Metrics are quantitative measurements that give insight into the behaviour and performance of a system. They represent aggregated data points over a specific period, such as response times, CPU utilization, memory consumption, or error rates. By monitoring and analyzing metrics, observability engineers can identify trends, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement.

- **Traces:** Traces provide a detailed view of the interactions and dependencies between different components of a system. They follow the flow of a request or transaction, capturing data about each step and the time taken. Traces enable engineers to visualise and analyze the performance and behaviour of individual requests, identify latency issues, and optimize the system's overall performance. 

## Observability Engineering Methodologies

Observability engineering involves adopting specific methodologies and practices to enhance system understanding and troubleshooting. Some commonly used methodologies include:

- **Distributed Tracing:** Distributed tracing allows engineers to trace the flow of requests across multiple services and microservices. It provides a holistic view of the system's behaviour, helps identify latency issues, and enables effective root cause analysis. **Distributed tracing works** by collecting data about each request, including the time it took to complete, the services it went through, and any errors that occurred. This data is then visualised in a tool called a span tree, which shows the relationships between requests and services. **Span trees **can be used to identify latency issues by showing where requests are spending the most time. They can also be used to identify root cause problems by showing which services are causing errors.
- **Log Analysis:** Log analysis involves aggregating and analyzing logs to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential issues. By using log management and analysis tools, engineers can extract valuable insights, detect errors, and troubleshoot problems more efficiently.

- **Metrics Monitoring:** Implementing a robust metrics monitoring system enables engineers to collect and analyze relevant metrics in real-time. This allows them to detect performance bottlenecks, optimize resource utilization, and ensure the system meets predefined thresholds.

Here are some additional tips for using observability engineering methodologies:

- Choose the right tools: There are a variety of observability tools available, so it is important to choose the right ones for your needs. Consider the size and complexity of your systems, the amount of data you need to collect, and your budget.
- Collect the right data: Not all data is created equal. When collecting data, focus on the data that is most relevant to your systems and the problems you are trying to solve.
- Analyze the data regularly: Don't wait for problems to occur before analyzing your data. Regularly analyze your data to identify potential issues and trends.
- Share the data with others: Don't keep your data to yourself. Share it with other engineers and stakeholders so that everyone has a complete understanding of your systems.
By following these tips, you can use observability engineering methodologies to improve the reliability, performance, and security of your systems.

## Observability Tools and Technologies

Observability engineering is supported by a wide array of tools and technologies designed to collect, analyze, and visualise data. Some popular observability tools include:

- **Prometheus**: Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system that collects metrics from your systems.
- **Grafana**: Grafana is an open-source visualization tool that can be used to display Prometheus metrics.
- **Elasticsearch**: Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine that can be used to store and search logs and traces.
- **Kibana**: Kibana is a visualization tool that can be used to display Elasticsearch data.
- **Jaeger**: Jaeger is an open-source distributed tracing system that can be used to collect traces from your systems.
- **SigNoz**: SigNoz is an open-source observability platform that provides a unified view of your systems' metrics, logs, and traces.
- **Dynatrace**: Dynatrace is a commercial observability platform that provides a comprehensive view of your systems' health and performance.
- **New** **Relic**: New Relic is a commercial observability platform that provides a comprehensive view of your systems' health and performance.
- **Datadog**: Datadog is a commercial observability platform that provides a comprehensive view of your systems' health and performance.

When choosing an observability tool, it is important to consider your specific needs. Some factors to consider include the size and complexity of your systems, the amount of data you need to collect, and your budget.

Once you have chosen an observability tool, you need to configure it to collect the data you need. You also need to develop a process for analyzing the data and identifying problems.

## Core Benefits

There are many benefits to observability engineering, including:

- **Improved** **reliability**: Observability engineering can help you identify and fix problems before they cause outages.
